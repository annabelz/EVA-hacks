# EVA-hacks

McHacks 2022 Project implemented by Annabel Zhu, Emily Benoit, and Vikram Nathan.

Goal: To use web scraping techniques to automatically generate a major degree plan for McGill University students, saving time and energy needed to consult an advisor.

The desired output is a website where the user can enter a major and be given a course plan.
